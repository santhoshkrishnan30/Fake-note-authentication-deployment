# FastAPI ML Model Deployment README

This repository contains a FastAPI application written in Python that deploys a machine learning model. This application serves as an example of deploying a machine learning model using FastAPI.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

cd <repository-directory>

3. Install the required Python dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This command will install all the necessary dependencies for running the FastAPI application.

## Usage

1. Train or obtain a machine learning model that you want to deploy. Save the trained model as a file in the repository directory.

2. Update the `predict` function in `app2.py` to load your trained model and define the prediction logic.

3. Run the FastAPI application by executing the following command:

uvicorn app2:app --reload

This command starts the Uvicorn server with auto-reload enabled. You should see output indicating that the server is running.

## Accessing the API

Once the server is running, you can access the API via your web browser or a tool like cURL. By default, the API should be accessible at:

http://localhost:8000

You can interact with the API by sending POST requests to the appropriate endpoints.

## API Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation based on your code. You can access the Swagger UI by visiting:

http://localhost:8000/docs

This documentation provides details on the available endpoints, request parameters, and responses.

## Shutting Down the Server

To stop the server, you can press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where it's running. This will gracefully shut down the Uvicorn process.

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions about this FastAPI application, please feel free to [open an issue](<repository-issues-url>) in this repository.

Happy coding!
